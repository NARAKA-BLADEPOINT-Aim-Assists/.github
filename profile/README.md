## üéØ Core Features

### 1. Dynamic Aim Curves

Tailor your aim response to the rhythm of NARAKA combat.

* Smooth factor: `0.25‚Äì0.85`
* FOV radius: `2.0‚Äì7.0`
* Supports **melee assist**, **projectile lock**, and **grapple tracking**
* Predicts **vertical recoil** from hero skills automatically

### 2. Target Priority System

Automatically identifies the **nearest or lowest-health** opponent within FOV range.

* **Hotkey Toggle:** `F3` to activate, `Shift` to hold aim
* **Modes:** Balanced / Aggressive / Steady
* **Custom weighting:** Distance (60%), Health (40%)

### 3. Hybrid Controller + Mouse Support

Native analog compatibility for DualSense and Xbox pads. Adjust aim assist strength via in-game overlay.

> [!NOTE]
> The assist logic uses incremental motion rather than full lock, ensuring natural crosshair behavior for both PC and controller players.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: Does this tool adjust for projectile travel time?**
Yes. The predictive model accounts for movement velocity and weapon type to offset aim latency.

**Q2: Can I use it in competitive play?**
Yes, but we recommend **Safe Mode injection** for maximum system stability.

**Q3: What‚Äôs the difference between Aim Assist and Aimbot?**
Aim Assist subtly guides your aim without full auto-locking ‚Äî designed for natural motion and precision enhancement.

**Q4: Will it affect my ping or FPS?**
No measurable drop. It runs asynchronously on GPU threads, maintaining full performance.

**Q5: How often is it updated?**
Weekly, synced with official NARAKA patch releases. Update notifications appear in the loader.
